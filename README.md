# functra - Function Flow Visualizer

functra is a powerful VS Code extension designed to **visualize function flow** within your codebase. It allows developers to track the execution of API functions and custom-made functions from start to end in an interactive **graph-based view**. With built-in search functionality, you can quickly find and explore specific functions within complex code structures.
